# BardBot Overview
BardBot is a Discord.py script to leverage the Google Bard API to power a Discord Bot to answer questions without having to leave discord. This was originally intended to be placed as a study guide helper, but there is potential for far more thanks to the power of the Google Bartd API. 

Please note, this code does not include any API keys for Bard or Discord. These would need to be created separately. 

# Changelog
As this is an alpha version, I will attempt to update this with each new update until this is a working project. As issues are resolved, the code will be updated with new 0.0.# version numbers. Once the script runs, the working version number will change to 1.0.## with the ## being the alpha build number. Version numbers will be formatted as Major Version . Feature Update . Run Number. 

12-6-2023 Version 0.0.1 - Currently, the project is in an alpha stage and does not function. The imports for the script fail to run and generates several errors as ntoed in the Issues section. 
12-7-2023 Version 0.0.2 - Corrected imports. The requests and api connection strings are now giving errors.
